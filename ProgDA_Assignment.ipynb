    "*What is a random number/sequence*\n",
    "\n",
    "A numeric sequence is said to be statistically random when it contains no recognizable patterns or regularities; sequences such as the results of an ideal dice roll or the digits of π exhibit statistical randomness.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why is it so difficult to generate a random number/sequence*\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers need instruction or programs to generate to do any task which includes generating random numbers. This means that an algrothim will also needed to generate a random number. The fact that there is an algrothim behind the generation means that it is not completely random and therefore these numbers are called pseudo random numbers (\"PRN\").[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What does numpy.random do\n",
    "\n",
    "As per official documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Numpy’s random number routines produce pseudo random numbers using combinations of a BitGenerator to create sequences and a Generator to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words any pseudo random numbers generator such as numpy.random will use an alogrothim to produce a stream of numbers which would exhibit statistical randomness. A 'seed' is often used as a 'starting point which is 'fed' into a software algrothim to produce a sequence of seemingly random numbers. The seed used can either be specified or can be automatically selected by e.g. the current date/time of the system running the generator etc.[4]   \n",

    "A 'Simple Random Data' function within numpy is, as the name suggests, a function to generate a 'simple' randomly generated value or array of values. Here simple means that each number within the range, has an equal chance of being selected/generated at every iteration of selection. A a real word example if we are rolling a die, each number from 1 to 6 has an equal chance of being selected on each roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is as opposed to data generated by a 'Distribution' which may have a certain 'weighting' towards certain values of range of values which may be expected to occur more frequently than others. An example of this is that if we are generating random values with regards to height of a population, we would expect the results to be skewed in way which would result in a greater number of values generated towards a 'mean' height.\n",
