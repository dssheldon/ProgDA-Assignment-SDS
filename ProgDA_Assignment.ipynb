    "\n",
    "There have been some changes to the numpy random module since version 1.17.0. These changes are summarised on the numpy wesite page below:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "A very brief overview of the changes are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy 1.17.0 introduces a new random number generator system. While the details of this (Bitgenerators and Generators) can be quite technical, simply put the older system made use of the global random generator object which was shared across the application. The newer system creates a random generator object with default_rng() and uses that object to generate random numbers without relying on the global state. The older system (RandomState) is not obsolete, rather, in most cases, it should be avoided whenever reproducible \"randomness\" is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The older system used the Mersenne Twister BitGenerator whereas the new system uses the the PCG65 Bitgenerator. As per numpy.org offical documentation(https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Call default_rng to get a new instance of a Generator, then call its methods to obtain samples from different distributions. By default, Generator uses bits provided by PCG64 which has better statistical properties than the legacy MT19937 used in RandomState."

    "##### The problem with generating randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is a random number/sequence*\n",
    "\n",
    "A numeric sequence is said to be statistically random when it contains no recognizable patterns or regularities; sequences such as the results of an ideal dice roll or the digits of π exhibit statistical randomness.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why is it so difficult to generate a random number/sequence*\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers need instruction or programs to generate to do any task which includes generating random numbers. This means that an algrothim will also needed to generate a random number. The fact that there is an algrothim behind the generation means that it is not completely random and therefore these numbers are called pseudo random numbers (\"PRN\").[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What does numpy.random do\n",
    "\n",
    "As per official documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Numpy’s random number routines produce pseudo random numbers using combinations of a BitGenerator to create sequences and a Generator to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words any pseudo random numbers generator such as numpy.random will use an alogrothim to produce a stream of numbers which would exhibit statistical randomness. A 'seed' is often used as a 'starting point which is 'fed' into a software algrothim to produce a sequence of seemingly random numbers. The seed used can either be specified or can be automatically selected by e.g. the current date/time of the system running the generator etc.[4]   \n",
