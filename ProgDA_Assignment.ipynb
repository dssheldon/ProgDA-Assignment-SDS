    "The assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. You are required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package. There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.\n",
    "2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.\n",

    "*What is a random number/sequence*\n",
    "\n",
    "A numeric sequence is said to be statistically random when it contains no recognizable patterns or regularities; sequences such as the results of an ideal dice roll or the digits of π exhibit statistical randomness.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why is it so difficult to generate a random number/sequence*\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers need instruction or programs to generate to do any task which includes generating random numbers. This means that an algrothim will also needed to generate a random number. The fact that there is an algrothim behind the generation means that it is not completely random and therefore these numbers are called pseudo random numbers.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What does numpy.random do\n",
    "\n",
    "As per official documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Numpy’s random number routines produce pseudo random numbers using combinations of a BitGenerator to create sequences and a Generator to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words any pseudo random numbers generator such as numpy.random will use a 'seed' as a 'starting point which is 'fed' into a software algrothim to prooduce a sequence of seemingly random numbers. The seed used can either be specified or can be automatically selected by e.g. the current date/time of the system running the generator etc.[4]   \n",
