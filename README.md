# ProgDA-Assignment-SDS
Repo for the ProgDA Assignment



#### Problem statement 

The assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. The objective is to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package. There are four distinct tasks in the Jupyter notebook. 

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package. 
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions. 
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

#### Contents of the repository

The contents of this repository are as follows:

1. .gitignore
2. LICENCE
3. Readme.md (this file)
4. ProgDA_Assignment.ipynb

#### Running the program

The program is contained within the Jupyter notebook 'ProgDA_Assignment.ipynb' which is the main file in the repository.

To open and run the file:

* Open the file in Jupyter notebooks
* Run the 'import' modules cell first

All documentation is contained within the workbook itself and so has not been reproduced here.
